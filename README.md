# NYC-Public-Seating
Exploratory analysis of public seating data in NYC w/ interactive visualizations

# Dataset
Data sourced form NYC Open Data, provided by NYC Department of Transportation

# Methods
The goal was to see if there was a pattern to public seating options in NYC provided by the Department of Transportation. Pandas functions are used to group data and visualize using Altair. The notebook contains bar graphs, time series graphs, and geospatial visualizations. All visualizations are interactive, allowing for different information to be viewed by hovering over the visualizations or selecting subgroups. 

# Conclusion
Ultimately, there was not an explicit pattern discovered by analyzing the data. There were a few trends that can be observed from the data and visualizations, such as an influx of Backless seating models being prioritized in recent years.
